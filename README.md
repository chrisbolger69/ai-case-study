Danelfin

* __*When was the company incorporated?*__
The Company was incorporated in 2016.

* __*Who is the founders of the company?*__
Thomas Diago is the founder of the company.

* __*How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?*__
Thomas realized that all the financial data on stocks was too much for one person to analyze and realized it needed AI.  Here is the quote:
> “How could retail investors analyze all that data to make well-informed decisions? He believed it was an impossible task for the human mind and therefore, Artificial Intelligence
> (AI) was the best technology to filter out the noise and provide data-driven insights.”

* __*How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?*__
The company was funded through crowd sourcing by a company called Crowdcube.  Danelfin received 295,000 Euros.

## Business Activities

* __*What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?*__
The company wanted to let the every day investor have the same tools that elite ivestors do.

* __*Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?*__
The companies intended customer is the every day small investor, the common man. As of January 2022, the company had 40,000 active and returning users.

* __*What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)*__
Their competitors are regular stock picking software.  By using AI the has an advantage of going over huge data sets including 6000 technical indicators, 150 technical insights,
and 150 social media sentiment metrics.  They are ranked 2nd in AI stock picking software.  They do have some competitors that also use AI to pick stock such as Altindex and 
Candlestick.

* __*Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)*__
Danelfin uses Machine Learning to analyze the data they pull.  They tell how the AI rates stocks, but it doesn't go into the details of the type of Machine Learning that is used.  
This is how the AI rates the stocks:

    * Stocks Data Collection
The data is collected and generates 900 technical, fundamental and sentiment indicators of each stock.

    * Stocks Data Analysis
The AI technology classifies the indicators into 10,000 possible stock features.  These are the attributes that the AI uses to compare stocks and search for alpha patterns.  From what I could find alpha patterns are images that are pixelated onto a grid. I am not sure if this is what they mean here. Then, the performance of the stocks in the past are used to identify the stock features that were more common among the stocks that generated the most alpha.  These are the "alpha signals"

    * Decision Trees
The AI analyzes the alpha signals for each stock and combines them with 500 decision trees to calculate the stock probability of beating the market within 60 days.

    * Probability Calculation
The final probablility for a given stock to beat the market is the average probability of all the decision trees.  An AI score is finally assigned to each stock based on this probability.

    * AI Calculation
AI scores are awarded from 1 to 10.  The higher the score, the higher the probability of beating the market.


## Landscape

* __*What field is the company in?*__
The company is in the financial technology field.  Specifically, it is in the stock picking software niche. What is does differently is to use AI to do this.

* __*What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?*__
At first AI was used by large institutions and hedge funds to stock pick.  Now we have entered an era where this has been democratized and the everday Joe stock picker can use 
this tool.  What is next is the use of AI to query and automate stock picking, buying and selling that is customizeable for a person's tastes, strategies, and risk tolerance.  
This technology is called stock bots. 

* __*What are the other major companies in this field?*__
Other companies in the field are Altindex, TrendSpider, Trade Ideas, Tickeron, BlockBoxStocks, Kavout and Candlestick. 

## Results

* __*What has been the business impact of this company so far?*__
The company has outperformed the S&P 500.  Between 2017 and 2022 the company was able to pick stocks that generated a growth of 158% while the S&P grew by 70%.  That
is more that doulbe the S&P.

* __*What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?*__
This is a new field.  Success is based on the accuracy in picking winning stocks and by their performance.  The company is private so their is no stock price to measure it by.
Another way to measure it's impact is by the number of people who use it per month. It's monthly visits growth is 68.18%  Other metrics as used by organizations that have ranked
AI picking software are whether they have apps on smartphones, the number of stocks they have in their database, the ease of use, the price, does it have charting and analysis
tools, explanations on how the AI works, and its the breath to which the software can be customized for its users.  

* __*How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?*__
It is rated the second best AI stocking picking software to use.  I can't find any data on which companies software has had the best performance on the market.

## Recommendations

* __*If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)*__
I would advise they offer the ability to chart and do analysis for the user.  I would further advise that they bring on a way for a user to customize the way they pick stocks. 
Things like the strategies they use, short selling, buy and hold.  The time frames the user is looking for; trading, buy and hold.  The risk tolerance of the user and things like
that.  Finally, I would advise they get on board the stock trading bot train.  Get their AI to allow users to buy, sell and hold stocks automatically based on their customizable
preferences.

* __*Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?*__
I believe the company would stay relevant on the front lines of stock picking AI, grab some market share from the other companies, and be able to pull in more users by offering
more perks and strategies that other investors might want.

* __*What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?*__
It would definitely use advanced machine learning AI for sure.  But it would also utilize good old fashioned programming, mostly on the web development side. It would also need 
decent cybersecurity to keep its user's financial information from being hacked, or manipulated.

* __*Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?*__
They increase customizability, ease of use, security, and stay on the forefront of AI technology.
